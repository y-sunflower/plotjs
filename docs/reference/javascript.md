`plotjs` offers a few utility functions to work with JavaScript, and a [guide](../guides/javascript/index.md) on how to work with JavaScript.

!!! warning

    You likely just want to use the `add_javascript()` method from the [PlotJS](plotjs.md) object instead of the following functions. Those are used under the hood and you can use them, but they might not provide you the simplest interface.
