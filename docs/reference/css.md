`plotjs` offers a few utility functions to work with CSS, and a [guide](../guides/css/index.md) on how to work with CSS.

!!! warning

    You likely just want to use the `add_css()` method from the [PlotJS](plotjs.md) object instead of the following functions. Those are used under the hood and you can use them, but they might not provide you the simplest interface.

::: plotjs.css.from_dict

<br>

::: plotjs.css.from_file

<br>

::: plotjs.css.is_css_like
