# `plotjs`: bridge between static matplotlib and interactive storytelling

`plotjs` is a proof of concept, inspired by [mpld3](https://github.com/mpld3/mpld3), to make matplotlib plots interactive (for the browser) with minimum user inputs.

The goal is also to give users a large customization power.

> Consider that the project is still **very unstable**.
